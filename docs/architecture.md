# LLMs.txt Security Analysis Platform: System Architecture

## Overview

The LLMs.txt Security Analysis Platform is designed with modular, clean architecture principles to ensure extensibility, maintainability, and testability. The system orchestrates the following core components:

- **Database Layer**: Manages metadata, content storage, and retrieval.
- **Content Layer**: Handles ingestion, parsing, and preprocessing of LLMs.txt and related files.
- **Analysis Layer**: Performs static, pattern-based, secret, and markdown analysis using pluggable analyzers. Includes robustness mechanisms such as content size limits, complexity detection, and alternative analysis paths for problematic content types.
- **Scoring Layer**: Assigns risk scores and classifications based on analysis results.
- **Reporting Layer**: Generates reports, dashboards, and alerts for stakeholders.

```

## Workflow

1. **Content Retrieval**: Content is fetched from the database or external sources.
2. **Content Processing**: Files are parsed and normalized for analysis.
3. **Analysis**: Multiple analyzers (static, pattern, secrets, markdown) process the content in parallel.
4. **Scoring**: Results are scored and risk is assessed.
5. **Reporting**: Reports, dashboards, and alerts are generated and stored.

## Orchestration

The pipeline orchestrator (`core/pipeline.py`) coordinates all components, manages workflow execution, error handling, and performance metrics. It implements dynamic, content-aware timeouts for analysis threads and ensures robust termination of underlying processes when timeouts occur.

## Extensibility

- **Plugins**: New analyzers and rules can be added via the `plugins/` and `rules/` directories.
- **Configuration**: System behavior is controlled via YAML and config files in `config/`.

## Error Handling & Recovery

- Robust error handling at each stage
- Logging and performance metrics for monitoring
- Recovery mechanisms for partial failures
- Layered timeout mechanisms at thread, process, and tool levels
- Alternative analysis paths for known problematic content types
- Graceful degradation when optimal analysis is not possible
