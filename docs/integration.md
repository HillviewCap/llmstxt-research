**Strengths:**
- Robust, modular core infrastructure.
- End-to-end execution without errors.

**Gaps:**
- Incomplete analysis coverage (static, markdown, YARA, advanced).
- Minimal reporting and no dashboard/alerting.
- No advanced features or performance validation.

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix static analysis to support in-memory or temp file content.
2. Implement and integrate markdown security, YARA, and advanced pattern matching.
3. Enhance reporting with detailed findings, evidence, and remediation.
4. Store results in the extended security schema.
5. Develop dashboard and alerting systems.
6. Expand test coverage for scalability and performance.
7. Plan for advanced features in future phases.

This section will be updated as progress continues.
