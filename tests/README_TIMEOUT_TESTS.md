# Static Analysis Timeout Fix Testing

This directory contains tests to verify the effectiveness of the static analysis timeout fix implementation. The original issue was a pipeline hanging on item 620 during static analysis with a timeout error.

## Implemented Fixes

The solution implemented:

1. **Improved handling of 'generic' language content in semgrep analysis**
   - Added detection of complex patterns in generic/markdown content
   - Implemented alternative analysis for complex content
   - Added conversion of markdown to 'generic' language for semgrep compatibility

2. **Enhanced timeout and process management**
   - Implemented dynamic timeout calculation based on content size and complexity
   - Added process group termination to ensure all child processes are terminated
   - Added thread stack trace capture on timeout for better debugging

3. **Added safeguards to prevent pipeline hangs**
   - Added content size checks (default 1MB limit)
   - Added line count checks (default 10,000 lines limit)
   - Implemented progressive timeouts based on content complexity

4. **Improved error handling and logging**
   - Added detailed error reporting with execution metrics
   - Added memory usage monitoring
   - Added child process termination for hung processes

## Test Files

- `test_static_analysis_timeout.py`: Contains test cases to verify the timeout fix
- `run_timeout_tests.py`: Script to run tests with both the fixed and simulated original implementation
- `data/large_complex_markdown.llms.txt`: Test file with complex markdown content
- `data/extremely_large_content.llms.txt`: Test file that exceeds the size limits

## Running the Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run the test script
python3 tests/run_timeout_tests.py

# Or run the tests directly with pytest
python3 -m pytest tests/test_static_analysis_timeout.py -v
```

The `run_timeout_tests.py` script:
1. Runs tests with the current (fixed) implementation
2. Temporarily modifies the code to simulate the original behavior
3. Runs tests with the simulated original implementation
4. Compares the results

## Test Results

The test results are saved in the `test_results` directory:
- `fixed_implementation_results.txt`: Results with the current implementation
- `original_implementation_results.txt`: Results with the simulated original implementation

## Test Cases

The test suite includes the following test cases:

1. **Large Complex Markdown Handling**: Tests handling of large complex markdown content
2. **Content Size Check**: Tests that content size checks prevent analysis of extremely large content
3. **Complex Generic Content Detection**: Tests detection of complex generic content
4. **Timeout Handling in Pipeline**: Tests timeout handling in the full pipeline
5. **Progressive Timeout**: Tests that timeout increases with content size and complexity
6. **Alternative Analysis for Complex Content**: Tests that alternative analysis is used for complex content
7. **Error Handling**: Tests that error handling provides useful information for debugging

## Expected Results

With the fixed implementation:
- All tests should pass
- Large/complex content should be handled without hanging
- Timeout mechanisms should work effectively
- Content size/complexity checks should trigger appropriate actions
- Error handling should provide useful information

With the simulated original implementation:
- Tests involving large/complex content should fail or hang
- Timeout mechanisms may not work effectively
- The pipeline may hang on complex content

## Troubleshooting

If the tests are not showing the expected improvements:

1. Check that semgrep is installed and available in the PATH
2. Verify that the test files are properly created
3. Check that the timeout values are appropriate for your system
4. Ensure that the process termination logic is working correctly
