This is a modified sample file for testing the temporal analysis pipeline.

It contains some basic text that can be used to test the version tracking,
change detection, and historical analysis components of the temporal pipeline.

This line has been modified to test change detection.

You can modify this file between runs to test how the temporal analysis
pipeline detects and analyzes changes over time.

Sample code block (modified):
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, modified world!")
    return "Modified function"
```

Sample markdown (with additions):
