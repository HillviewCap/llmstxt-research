"""
Tests to verify the fixes for static analysis timeout issues.

This test file focuses on:
1. The fix for the TypeError in semgrep_runner (converting string content size to integer)
2. The fix for markdown analyzer timeout (size checks and early exits)
3. Verification that all analyzers respect their size limits
4. Testing with various content sizes
5. Ensuring no timeouts occur with test cases
